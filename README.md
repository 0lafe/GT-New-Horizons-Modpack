Large Modpack with every recipe Gregified
-

Hey guys, I'd like to open up my project and get more players.
I've been working on it for six months and still got a lot more work to do.

The pack has around 160 mods that are carefully selected and balanced between each other and GregTech. I've created a Tiering system that follows GT. You can't get lategame stuff without lategame GT!
An example of Tiering (work in progress) is here:

Tier 0: Vanilla Minecraft, Pam's Harvestcraft, GT Flint tools
Tier 1: GT Bronze Age, TiCo, Chisel, Jabba, Twillight Forest
Tier 2: GT (LV), Railcraft, Forestry, Extra Utilities, Backpacks
Tier 3: GT (MV), Thaumcraft (+Addons), Binnie, Advanced Solar Panels, AE2
Tier 4: GT (HV), Galacticraft (+Addons), AFSU, Witchery
Tier 5: GT (EV), Gendustry, Blood Magic

The server is so complex and heavily modified we're creating our own WIKI (WIP) - link is in Github.
The number of mod interactions in this pack is beyond the scope of this thread.


What does this pack have to offer?

*Technology*
Everything you do is tied to GT as it should be. I'm using my own mods DreamCraftCore (for items) and MinetweakerGTAddon allowing me to use various GT machines I wouldn't be able to otherwise.
You can also look forward to TiCo, Railcraft, Forestry, Extra Utilities, Openblocks, AE2, Buildcraft, Galacticraft with many addons, Gendustry, Steve's Carts, Open Computers and many others.

*Magic*
Many mods are carefully tied to Thaumcraft. Its addons like Forbidden Magic, Automagy, Thaumic Tinkerer, Thaumic Exploration, Thaumic Horizons etc. are also modified.
When you've progressed enough you can reach Witchery or even Blood Magic.

*Exploration*
Using Realistic World Gen along with Biomes'o'Plenty creates a wonderful terrain. With Twillight Forest (that you need to conquer to reach endgame Thaumcraft), Galacticraft and other mods the server has over EIGHT dimensions.
Rogue-like Dungeons and HEE with other mods' worldgen make sure you got some goodies to find.

*Survival*
Hunger Overhaul, Pam's Harvestcraft, Special Mobs, Special AI, HEE, Infernal Mobs, Lava Monsters, Zombie Awareness. Do I need to continue?

You want to roam the land and kill everything in sight with ease, build a highly advanced MagicTech base and raid all the dungeons in Minecraft? Sure, you can. You got a long journey ahead though.
